# Notes Collection

## Date: 9/8

### Goal:
Develop a gym plan that I can start on the morning of **Friday, 9/13**.

- Don’t need to read the entire book – can skip sections that don’t directly relate to the goal (fat loss, nutrition, overall food editing).
- Mostly focus on what exercises are most/least effective.
- Minimal focus on diet as it pertains to building muscle.
- Finalize plan before the end of the week – simple/straightforward to follow.

### Ch 0: Bonus
- Reference: [biggerleanerstronger.com/bonus](https://biggerleanerstronger.com/bonus)
  - Links to training demonstration videos.
  - List of favorite tools for retention.

### Ch 5–6: Definitions

### Ch 7: 10 Worst Fat Loss Myths
- **Energy balance:** Calories in vs calories out → gain weight.
- Dietary fat similar to body fat → only retain 0–2% of energy to convert.
- Alcohol can’t be stored as body fat but blunts fat burning → ↑ rate of carbs to body fat.
- Training muscle doesn’t burn the fat covering them.
- Meal frequency is unimportant for energy expenditure/weight loss.
- To lose fat but not muscle, need resistance training.

---

### Ch 8: Worst Muscle-Building Myths
- Heavy weightlifting = strength gain ≠ mass gain.
- **Newbie gains:** 6–8 months of hyper-responsive muscle gain.
- **Progressive overload:** Increase reps, size, strength by progressively adding weight.
- Core lifts (dumbbell, barbell) > machines for gaining muscle/strength.
- Compound exercises → involve multiple joints/muscles.
  - More efficient → allow lifting heavier weights → better progressive overload.

---

### Ch 9: 3 Little Big Things About Rapid Fat Loss
- Reference: Michael Moss’s “Salt, Sugar, Fat” explains science behind food/diet.
- Digestion impacts fat storage/postprandial state.
- After digestion, "fasted" state burns fat.
- To gain muscle and not fat, proper diet and exercise balance are key.

---

### Ch 10: 3 Little Big Things About Building Muscle
- **3 Pathways to Muscle Building:**
  1. Mechanical tension → Most important.
  2. Light, high-rep → Muscle endurance.
  3. Muscle growth → Protein synthesis > breakdown.
- Sleep deprivation inhibits muscle gain.
- Protein and carbs are essential for muscle repair and growth.
- A high-protein, high-carb diet is ideal for muscle building.

---

### Ch 14: How to Train Willpower
- Self-control peaks in the morning, declines throughout the day.
- Train willpower with regular small acts of self-control.
- Use strategies like pre-commitments and "pause-and-plan" responses to increase adherence.

---

### Ch 15: Finding Biggest Fitness Whys
- Establish fitness goals with visual references (3–4 ideal body pictures).
- Use affirmations and categorize goals into:
  - Physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.

---

### Ch 16: Diet Advice
1. How much you eat is more important than what you eat.
2. Majority of calories should come from nutrient-dense, minimally processed food.
3. Set a schedule that fits your goals and is easy to stick to.

---

### Ch 17–20: TODO
- Calculate calories/macros.
- Pre/post-workout nutrition.
- Make a meal plan.
- Learn how to "cheat" on a diet.

---

### Ch 21: Deload Week
- Weekly reduction in training intensity (weight lifted) or volume.
- Alleviates fatigue, reduces strain, and prevents injury.
- Signs that deload is needed: Progress stalls, sleep quality decreases, or motivation drops.

#### How to Avoid Injuries:
- Gradual progression → Add 10 lbs to lifts every 1–2 weeks.
- Avoid repetitive stress injuries (RSI).
- Pay attention to pain → Rest and adapt training accordingly.

---

### Ch 21: Double Progression
- Use progressive overload by increasing reps, weight, or both.
- Avoid reaching absolute failure, which isn’t necessary for strength gains.

#### Warm-Up Guidelines:
- 10 reps with 50% of target weight (1 min rest).
- Gradual increases to prepare muscles and improve form.

#### Intensity/Focus:
- Focus solely on the task at hand, minimizing distractions.

### Part 5: Exercise Advice
**Date:** 9/8

#### Ch 21: Ultimate Workout Plan for Men

- **2–3 major muscle groups trained per workout:**
  - **PPL Split:**
    - **Push:** Chest, shoulders, triceps.
    - **Pull:** Back, biceps.
    - **Legs:** Including hamstrings.

- **4–6 reps per hard set:**
  - Weights usually around 80–85% of 1RM.
  - Heavy, low-rep → High muscle gain/strength.
  - Not so heavy that struggle to control weights → Injury.
  - Significant muscle gain requires taking sets close to technical failure (difficult but high-rep).
  - For most hard sets (except some isolation exercises or rare reps).

- **9–15 hard sets per workout.**

- **2–4 minutes rest between hard sets:**
  - Rest preps muscles to exert maximum effort in each set.
  - More rest → More reps → More muscle growth.
  - Rest slightly less (~2 min) for smaller muscle groups (arms, shoulders).
  - Rest more (~4 min) for larger groups (back, legs) if 1RM hasn’t settled or need more rest.
  - **Supersets:** Good to save time (knife edge w/ downtime).

- **3–5 train major muscle groups every 3–5 days:**
  - Most important: How heavy weights are & how many hard sets per week.
  - Frequency (# workouts/week) less important than overall volume (total sets/week).

- **1–2 days off/week:**
  - No more than 6 days/week → Serious exercise (progressive or high-intensity cardio).
  - Intense exercise without rest → Physical & mental burnout.

- **8–10 rest every 8–10 weeks:**
  1. Reduce workout intensity/volume (deloading).
  2. Take 5–7 days off (if weightlifting).

---

### Ch 22: Cardio
- Cardio is not critical for muscle building but helps with fat loss.
- **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):**
  - 20–25 minutes, 2–3 sessions per week.
  - Alternate sprints with low-intensity recovery.

---

### Ch 23: Best Exercises
- Focus on major muscle groups: Chest, shoulders, back, arms, core, and legs.
- **Best chest exercises include:**
  - Barbell/Dumbbell bench press (incline/flat).
  - Dips and cable fly.

### Internet Research Notes: Lower Back Pain
#### My Injury: L5 Spondylolisthesis
- Pars fracture causes vertebra to shift forward.

#### Grading of Slippage:
- G1: 0–25%.
- G2: 26–50%.
- G3: 51–75%.
- G4: 76–100%.
- **My injury:** ~30% (low Grade 2).

#### Treatment Recommendations:
- Use heat and NSAIDs to manage pain and inflammation.
- Physical therapy focused on flexibility and stretching.

---

### Back Brace?
- Back braces provide short-term relief but weaken muscles over time.
- Focus on exercises that stabilize the spine, such as squats and deadlifts.
